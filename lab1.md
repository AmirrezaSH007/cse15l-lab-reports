   .
2) cd with a path to a directory as an argument: /Users/seyedamirrezashamstaleghani/cse15l-lab-reports      Changes the current working directory to cse15l.lab.reports. There will be no error. Again, the output is not visible unless we use pwd command.

   .
3) cd with a path to a file as an argument: It gives an error because cd can't navigate into file. Since index.md is a file and not a directory. cd is used to change directories not accessing files.
